# Face-Detection-App



Objective - To create a face detection web app using computer vision and have continuous improvement and continuous delivery of the app using Devops.

Technology used : Reactjs, Nodejs, MongoDB, Clarifai CV API, GitHub, Heroku.

Model used : We used clarifai platform's computer vision api to detect a face in an image.

Devops Implementation : 
We created the web app using Nodejs. Reactjs. MongoDB and stored codebase in GitHub repo.
Then connected that repo to Heroku creating a pipeline to automatically deploy the repo's app on heroku platform.
Because of the connected pipeline when we update code in the GitHub changes are automatically pushed to Heroku deployment also. 
Thia gives us continuous improvement and delivery of the app.
